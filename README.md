# Hi there, I’m [Rick](https://www.rickarocho.com/) 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer who has 3+ years of experience developing beautifully responsive websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and JavaScript.

In love with bringing designs to life through code I decided to attend App Academy and dedicated the past year to further sharpening my skills. I planned, designed, and crafted 4 full stack applications built using React, Python, Express, Flask, and Pug.
